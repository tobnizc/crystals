# Crystals.com Authentic Healing Stones: Hand-Selected Quality, Ethically Sourced, Fast Shipping

So you're thinking about buying crystals online. Maybe you've been scrolling Instagram, seeing those gorgeous amethyst geodes and rose quartz towers, wondering if they're the real deal or just pretty rocks with a good filter. Here's the thing—most online crystal shops fall into one of two camps: either they're selling mass-produced fakes dyed in some factory, or they're charging you a small fortune for "museum-quality" pieces that look suspicingly like the $20 versions on other sites.

Then there's Crystals.com, a different kind of operation altogether.

I have them around my work desk to help with focus, concentration and anti-anxiety. It's hard to find REAL functional crystals and crystals.com really takes the guessing game out."* — Verified Customer
